# OpenZeppelin Ethernaut Level 8

Unlock the Vault! 

A few repositories back we went through [Private Variable Exploit](https://github.com/ishinu/Private-Variable-Exploit-) in Solidity.

That is one way to exploit private variable using Truffle but in this project we will do it simply by running a script. ( `1_deploy_vault.js` )

Here is another implementation of how you can get the values of private variables.

## Terminal commands to execute the project

- Clone the repository by `git clone https://github.com/ishinu/OpenZeppelin-Ethernaut-Level-8`
- Run `npm install` in terminal.
- Run `node scripts/1_deploy_vault.js` in terminal to get the password.

Rest is history~!
